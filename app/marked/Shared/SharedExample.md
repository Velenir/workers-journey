# Example of a Shared Worker

Let's build a minimalistc example of a **Shared Worker**.

First our `sharedworker.js` code:

```js
!!!include(./Shared/sharedworker.js)!!!
```

And interaction logic on the **Main thread**:

```html
!!!include(./Shared/example.html)!!!
```

With styling applied it can be represented like the panel below. Try interacting with it.
