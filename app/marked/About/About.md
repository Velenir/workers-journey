# About

This site was created partially to consolidate and clarify the knowledge I've acquired while learning to work with **Web Workers**, partially to record my exploration of their different aspects, my *Worker's Journey* if you will, and partially to share all that with the community.

I hope it can serve if not as a go-to guide on the subject (official resources from the previous page serve that purpose better), then as useful supporting material.

As you have noticed, dear reader, I have yet to cover **Service Workers** and other topics you are surely thinking of. This is very much a work in progress, which I will to as soon as I have anything substantial to add.
