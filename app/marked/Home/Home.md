"JavaScript is single-threaded", cries the crowd.

"But couldn't we... like in AJAX...", you mumble uncertainly.

"JavaScript is single-threaded!" the front row shrieks in a frenzy.

"... maybe in a separate context...", you hesitate to continue lest you provoke your audience further.

"Down with the blasphemer!" an angry voice reaches from somewhere behind the crowd.

You gather your strength and make a desperate last appeal, "Let the browser manage it, like a separate tab or an iframe". But it falls on deaf ears.
"Down with him! Down!" resounds through the crowd.

Bitterly disappointed and indignant you turn to leave the stage when something hits you. A soft splash against your coat and a smell of overripe fruit immediately after. You stop in your tracks and look at it. A tomato ("Not a fruit then", you catch yourself thinking) lies under your feet, brown with rot and smashed into a puddle by the impact, a foul smelling stain is left on your clothes. You can't believe your eyes, these Luddites threw a tomato at you.

A second tomato flies past you and then an equally rotten apple falls a good meter short of its target. You hurry to leave, but before disappearing behind the stage you steal a quick glance at the raging crowd. A momentary shock overcomes you. Before you a sea of people, faces distorted, some hurling unsavory objects in your directing, others -- curses in absence of anything more substantial, and this sea... it stands still.

Then suddenly the crowd jerks forward, for a second as if for a few frames. A new barrage of rotten fruit flies into the air... and stops. People's motion grinds to a halt, fruits in the air unimaginably suspended.

Unwilling to tempt fate, you quickly escape the stage, the square and duck into a side street in case someone gets a bright idea to pursue.

A minute passes in silence, the crowd sporadically moves for a moment and stops. Suddenly an alarm sounds from a nearby textile factory announcing lunch break. A flood of workers rushes out onto the square washes around the frozen people, an occasional worker bumping into one of them, apologizing and rushing on. Soon the square is empty but for the original group, still rooted in place.

In the next 10 minutes their faces relax, the crowd's fervor winds down, the air clears of the flying fruits and the timeflow slowly regains normal fps.
Bewilderment replaces anger in the people's eyes, then understanding. Some even consider joining up with the workers, who are seemingly immune to time lags.

Then maybe they'll catch the next blasphemer.
